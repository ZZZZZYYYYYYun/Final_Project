Create a FORK of this repository to store your code, data, and documentation for the final project. Detailed instructions for this assignment are in the course Moodle site.  The reason I'm asking you to fork this empty repository instead of creating a stand-alone repository is that it will be much easier for me and all students in the course to find all of our projects for code review and for grading. You can even get code review from students in the other section of IS590PR this way.

Even though your fork of this repository shall be public, you'll still need to explicitly add any students on your team as Collaborators in the Settings. That way you can grant them write privileges.

TEMPLATE for your report:

# Title: 

## Team Member(s): Jianshan Yang，Parth Ved，Yanyu Wang，Yun Zhou
(Note: Don't put your email addresses here (which is public).  If a student wants their NAME hidden as well, due to optional FERPA regulations, they can be listed purely by their GitHub ID).

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
(be sure to read the instructions given in course Moodle)
Nowdays, investors planning to invest in properties often consider various factors before actually picking a property. We are considering Monte Carlo Simulation for Resturant owner and what would be the best location for them to open a new resturant. The main purpose of the project is to determine which location would yeild more profit and in turn is a better location. We also ask the owner for the resturant size preference and based on it, we would provide the result. 

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:

We search the information about the Business Model of restuarants and could calculate the number of people come to the restaurants. We also know the longest time they would like to wait in a restaurant.
